    Acts as a safe version of isinstance without having to explicitly
    import packages which may not exist in the users environment.

    Checks if obj is an instance of type specified by class_path_str.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj: Any
        Some object you want to test against
    class_path_str: str or list
        A string or list of strings specifying full class paths
        Example: `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`

    Returns
    -------
    bool: True if isinstance is true and the package exists, False otherwise
